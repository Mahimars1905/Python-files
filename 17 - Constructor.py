# Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors 
# is to initialize (assign values) to the data members of the class when an object
# of the class is created. 

# class Employee:
#     increment = 2000
    
#     def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
#         self.emp_name = name
#         self.emp_age = age
#         self.emp_salary = salary
        
# obj1 = Employee("Rahul", 23, 23000)        
# obj2 = Employee("Ravi", 22, 22000)

# print(obj1.emp_name)
# print(Employee.increment)
